    I have the openai scraper retrieving the article titles and topics, this will be useful to scrape the 
    news website (pbs.org). That's the next step, be able to use beautiful soup to retrieve the content on 
    a specific article :3

    The following are title outputs:
        - 1. "Continued Israeli airstrikes flatten parts of Rafah amid slow progress for Gaza cease-fire" - World
        - 2. "Capitol Hill fight over spending pushes country closer to government shutdown" - Politics
        - 3. "Measles cases are rising in the U.S. Here’s why misinformation about the vaccine persists today" - Health
        - 4. "WATCH: President Biden�s Address to the Nation | PBS NewsHour�s full evening coverage" - Politics
        - 5. "WATCH LIVE: White House holds daily briefing ahead of National Governors Association Winter Meeting" - Politics
    The goal is to turn one of those inputs into a url we can extract information from.

    plan: 
        # 1. get output from title_scrape (use demo output first)
        # 2. create a function that takes the title/politics string as input and outputs it as a website link
        # 3. create a function that takes the link as input and outputs the contents as a string
        # 4. Create a function that takes the string as input and uploads to a database.
        # 5. Set up post get api calls

    update plans:
    - when calling this api the url will be kept on a .env for security
    - idea, make gpt send results as json to make it easier to gather data ( did not work :[ )
    - skip first two lines of the output and split the text by new line into an array (split function)

    - make if statements for not specified type articles and special case titles like (. , WATCH, WATCH LIVE:)
